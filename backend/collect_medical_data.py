- Elevated: Systolic 120-129 and diastolic less than 80
- Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or diastolic 80-89
- Stage 2: Systolic 140/90 or higher
- Hypertensive Crisis: Higher than 180/120 (seek emergency care)

SYMPTOMS:
- Most people have no symptoms
- Severe hypertension may cause: headaches, shortness of breath, nosebleeds
- Complications may cause: chest pain, vision changes, blood in urine

CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS:
- Primary hypertension: No identifiable cause (most common)
- Secondary hypertension: Caused by underlying conditions
- Risk factors: Age, family history, obesity, sedentary lifestyle
- Diet high in salt and low in potassium
- Smoking, excessive alcohol use, chronic stress
- Sleep apnea, kidney disease, thyroid problems

TREATMENT:
- Lifestyle changes: DASH diet, regular exercise, weight management
- Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day
- Medications: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers
- Regular blood pressure monitoring
- Management of underlying conditions

PREVENTION:
- Maintain healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9)
- Exercise regularly (30 minutes most days)
- Eat a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables
- Limit alcohol consumption and don't smoke
- Manage stress through relaxation techniques
- Get adequate sleep (7-8 hours per night)

- Chest tightness or pain
- Wheezing when exhaling (common in children)
- Trouble sleeping due to shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing
- Coughing or wheezing attacks worsened by respiratory viruses

TYPES OF ASTHMA:
- Allergic asthma: Triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, pet dander
- Non-allergic asthma: Triggered by factors like stress, weather changes, exercise
- Occupational asthma: Caused by workplace irritants
- Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: Triggered by physical activity

COMMON TRIGGERS:

- Biologics for severe allergic asthma
- Bronchial thermoplasty for severe cases

PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT:
- Identify and avoid personal triggers
- Take controller medications as prescribed
- Use proper inhaler technique
- Get vaccinated against flu and pneumonia
