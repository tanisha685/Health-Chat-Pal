MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is diabetes?Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.What are the types of diabetes?There are different types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.Gestational diabetes. This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.What causes diabetes?The different types of diabetes have different causes:Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.Who is more likely to develop diabetes?The different types of diabetes have different risk factors:You can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it.You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:Are overweight or have obesity.Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults.Have a family history of diabetes.Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes.Had gestational diabetes.Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.Are not physically active.Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).You are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you:Are overweight or have obesity.Have a family history of diabetes.Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.What are the symptoms of diabetes?The symptoms of diabetes may include:Feeling very thirstyFeeling very hungryUrinating (peeing) more often, including at nightFatigueBlurry visionNumbness or tingling in the feet or handsSores that do not healLosing weight without tryingBut it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe.With type 2 diabetes, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them.Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. How is diabetes diagnosed?To find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test.What are the treatments for diabetes?Treatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin.If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines to manage their diabetes.If you have gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.Can diabetes be prevented?Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented.You may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth. Type 1 diabetes happens most often in children and young adults but can appear at any age. Symptoms may include: Being very thirsty Urinating often Feeling very hungry or tired Losing weight without trying Having sores that heal slowly Having dry, itchy skin Losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet Having blurry eyesight A blood test can show if you have diabetes. If you do, you will need to take insulin for the rest of your life. A blood test called the A1C can check to see how well you are managing your diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.What causes type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:Being overweight or having obesityNot being physically activeGenetics and family historyType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:Are over age 45.

If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:Increased thirst and urinationIncreased hungerFeeling tiredBlurred visionNumbness or tingling in the feet or handsSores that do not healUnexplained weight lossHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 monthsFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.What is gestational diabetes?Some people already have diabetes before they get pregnant. But others may develop diabetes during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. It usually develops around the 24th week of pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy, along with genetic and lifestyle factors.Who is more likely to develop gestational diabetes?Anyone who is pregnant could develop gestational diabetes. But you are more likely to develop it if you:Are overweight or have obesityHave a family history of diabetesHad gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancyHave given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or moreHave polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander personHow do I know if I have gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.If you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.For these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours. How can diabetes affect my pregnancy?Having diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:You are more likely to develop preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure.You are more likely to need a cesarean delivery, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan, physical activity routine, and/or medicines. If you have any diabetes health problems, they may get worse during pregnancy.Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.Having diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects.Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.Your baby is more likely to be born early.Your baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth.There is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.How can I manage diabetes during pregnancy?There are steps you can take to manage your diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy.If you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant. High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which diabetes medicines are safe during pregnancy.During your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take diabetes medicines. It's also important that you: Get regular prenatal checkupsTake your prenatal vitaminsDon't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugsAfter pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:If you had gestational diabetes, you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years.If you already had diabetes before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your diabetes management plan.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.Now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are overweight or have obesity, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active. Children who are African American, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children:Have them maintain a healthy weightBe sure they are physically activeHave them eat smaller portions of healthy foodsLimit time with the TV, computer, and videoChildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin. A blood test called the A1C can check on how you are managing your diabetes.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is type 2 diabetes?If you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, this happens because your body does not make enough insulin, or it does not use insulin well (this is called insulin resistance). If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might be able to prevent or delay developing it.Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes?Many Americans are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors include:Having prediabetes, which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetesBeing overweight or having obesityBeing age 45 or olderA family history of diabetesBeing African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific IslanderHaving high blood pressureHaving a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglyceridesA history of diabetes in pregnancyHaving given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or moreAn inactive lifestyleA history of heart disease or strokeHaving depressionHaving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Having acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpitsSmokingHow can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes?If you are at risk for diabetes, you may be able to prevent or delay getting it. Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes are:Losing weight and keeping it off.Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.Following a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.Get regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.Talk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.What health problems can diabetes cause?Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet.Gum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels.Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients.Sexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder.Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.What other problems can people with diabetes have?If you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that are too high (hyperglycemia) or too low for you (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood glucose regularly.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is asthma?Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.What causes asthma?The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mitesMoldPetsPollen from grass, trees, and weedsWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold airCertain medicinesHousehold chemicalsInfections such as colds and the fluOutdoor air pollutionTobacco smoke Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at workExercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dryAsthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.Who is at risk for asthma?Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma:Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small childBeing exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dustsGenetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergiesOften having viral respiratory infections as a young childSex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.What are the symptoms of asthma?The symptoms of asthma include:Chest tightnessCoughing, especially at night or early morningShortness of breathWheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe outThese symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.How is asthma diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:Physical examMedical historyLung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs workTests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effortFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.What are the treatments for asthma?If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include:Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.

They can include Dust mitesMoldPetsPollen from grass, trees, and weedsWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold airCertain medicinesHousehold chemicalsInfections such as colds and the fluOutdoor air pollutionTobacco smoke Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dryAsthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.Which children are at risk for asthma?Certain factors raise the risk of asthma in children:Being exposed to secondhand smoke when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small childrenGenetics and family history. Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergiesOften having viral respiratory infections as young childrenSex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls.What are the symptoms of asthma in children?The symptoms of asthma in children include:Chest tightnessCoughing, especially at night or early morningBreathing problems, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for airFeeling tiredDark circles under the eyesBeing irritableWheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe outTrouble eating or sucking (in infants)These symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may happen often or only once in a while.When children have an asthma attack, their symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. Warning signs of a severe attack include severe coughing, serious breathing problems, and turning very pale or blue in the face, lips and/or fingernails. If your child has those symptoms, get medical help right away.How is asthma in children diagnosed?It can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead.Your child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:Physical examMedical historyChest x-rayLung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.If you have a young child who cannot do lung function tests, the provider may suggest doing a trial of asthma medicines. The trial involves giving your child the medicines for several weeks to see whether the symptoms get better.What are the treatments for asthma in children?If your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as:Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child, you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car.Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to have for your child at all times. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your child's airways.Control medicines. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Not all children will take control medicines. Whether or not your child needs them depends on how severe the asthma is and how often your child has symptoms.If your child has a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, get medical help right away.Your child's provider may adjust the treatment until the asthma symptoms are controlled.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are:PollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elasticThe walls between many of the air sacs are destroyedThe walls of the airways become thick and inflamedThe airways make more mucus than usual and can become cloggedWhat are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?COPD includes two main types:Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.Chronic bronchitis, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD.Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?The risk factors for COPD include:Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplaceAge. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD.What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucusWheezingA whistling or squeaky sound when you breatheShortness of breath, especially with physical activityTightness in your chestSome people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptomsA family historyVarious tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood testsYour doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:Lifestyle changes, such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritantsAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.Medicines, such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseasesAntibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infectionOxygen therapy, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include An exercise programDisease management trainingNutritional counselingPsychological counselingSurgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines: For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that: Remove damaged lung tissueRemove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. For severe COPD, some people may need lung transplantIf you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented?Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is the flu?The flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.What causes the flu?The flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.What are the symptoms of the flu?Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigue (tiredness)Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu. There are differences between them:Signs and SymptomsColdFluStart of symptomsSlowlySuddenlyFeverRarelyUsuallyAchesSometimes (slight)UsuallyFatigue, weaknessSometimesUsuallyHeadacheRarelyCommonStuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throatCommonSometimesSometimes people say that they have a "flu" when they really have something else. For example, "stomach flu" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis.What other problems can the flu cause?Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:BronchitisEar infectionSinus infectionPneumoniaInflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu.Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including:Adults 65 and olderPregnant womenChildren younger than 5People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseaseHow is the flu diagnosed?To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.What are the treatments for the flu?Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.Can the flu be prevented?The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

MEDICAL CONDITION: Smoking
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are the health effects of smoking?There's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every organ of the body, even some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes many cancers and other health problems. It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States.Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include:Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, colon and rectum, and cervix. It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lung diseases. Smoking is the most common cause of COPD. It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia.Cardiovascular diseases. Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure. Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke.Vision problems. Smoking can raise your risk of cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD).You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant. Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking.What are the health risks of secondhand smoke?Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke, they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight.Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous?Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes.E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals.Smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions.Why should I quit?Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include:Lower heart rate and blood pressureLess carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen)Better circulationLess coughing and wheezingQuitting smoking can be challenging, but it is so important for your health. Contact your health care provider if you need help quitting.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Ozone is a gas. It can be good or bad, depending on where it is. "Good" ozone occurs naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth's surface. It shields us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Part of the good ozone layer is gone. Man-made chemicals have destroyed it. Without enough good ozone, people may get too much ultraviolet radiation. This may increase the risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system problems."Bad" ozone is at ground level. It forms when pollutants from cars, factories, and other sources react chemically with sunlight. It is the main ingredient in smog. It is usually worst in the summer. Breathing bad ozone can be harmful. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, worsening of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. It can lead to permanent lung damage, if you are regularly exposed to it.Environmental Protection Agency

MEDICAL CONDITION: High Blood Pressure
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.How is high blood pressure diagnosed?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80Elevated120 - 129andLess than 80High Blood Pressure Stage 1130 - 139or80 - 89High Blood Pressure Stage 2140 or higheror90 or higherHypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away)Higher than 180andHigher than 120For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.:Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure?When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure.What are the treatments for high blood pressure?Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type.If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension, sometimes called PH, is a serious condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.Your heart pumps blood to your lungs so they can add oxygen to the blood. The blood goes back to your heart. From there, it travels to the rest of your body so that your tissues can get the oxygen that they need.The blood moves from your heart to your lungs through blood vessels called pulmonary arteries. If the pulmonary arteries become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, the blood does not flow through them as well. This can increase the blood pressure in the arteries and cause pulmonary hypertension.There are different types of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The different types are based on what caused the disease.What causes pulmonary hypertension?Pulmonary hypertension can develop on its own or be caused by another condition. Sometimes the cause is unknown or is not clear.Some of the possible causes include:Heart diseases, including left-sided heart failure and congenital heart diseaseLung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and sleep apneaOther medical conditions such as: Liver diseasesSickle cell diseasePulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs)Connective tissue disorders like scleroderma Who is more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension? Certain factors can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension, such as:Your age. The risk increases as you get older. The condition is usually diagnosed between ages 30 and 60.Your environment. Being exposed to asbestos or having certain infections caused by parasites can raise your risk.Your family history and genetics. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, and Gaucher disease, can raise your risk of pulmonary hypertension. So can a family history of blood clots.Your lifestyle habits.Smoking and illegal drug use can raise your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension.Certain medicines. For example, some medicines used to treat cancer and depression can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension.Your sex. Pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than in men.What are the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension?The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are sometimes hard to recognize and are similar to the symptoms of other medical conditions. So sometimes it can take years for someone to get diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension.The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include:Shortness of breathChest pain or pressureDizziness that may lead to faintingFatigueSwelling of the abdomen, legs, or feetHeart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is pounding or beating too fast)What other problems can pulmonary hypertension cause?Pulmonary hypertension can get worse over time and lead to serious problems, including:Anemia, which can cause your body to not get enough oxygen-rich bloodArrhythmias, problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatBlood clots in the pulmonary arteriesBleeding in the lungsHeart failureLiver damagePericardial effusion, a collection of fluid around the heartSerious pregnancy complicationsHow is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed?To find out if you have pulmonary hypertension, your health care provider:Will ask about your medical history and symptomsWill do a physical exam, which may include checking your blood oxygen, listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressureWill likely order some tests, such as: Blood tests to look for blood clots, stress on the heart, or anemiaHeart imaging tests, such as a cardiac MRILung imaging tests, such as chest x-rayAn electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) What are the treatments for pulmonary hypertension?Often there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but treatments can help manage your symptoms. Your provider will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. It will be based on your needs and the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. The plan may include:Healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Healthy eating, which includes eating less saltRegular physical activity, which may be done through pulmonary rehabilitation Medicines, such as: Blood thinnersMedicines to control the rate blood is pumped throughout the bodyMedicines to relax blood vessels and allow the blood to flow betterMedicine to reduce swelling (diuretics) Oxygen therapyProcedures to reduce pressure in the heart or pulmonary arteryIn some severe cases, a lung transplantNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Around half of American adults have high blood pressure (hypertension). Many of those people don't know they have it because there are usually no warning signs. This can be dangerous, because high blood pressure can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health.What is blood pressure?Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers:Systolic pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when your heart beatsDiastolic pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside your arteries when your heart rests between beatsAs an example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.How is high blood pressure diagnosed?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis:Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80Elevated120 - 129andLess than 80High Blood Pressure Stage 1130 - 139or80 - 89High Blood Pressure Stage 2140 or higheror90 or higherHypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away)Higher than 180andHigher than 120For children and teens, the provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure?Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:Age. Blood pressure tends to rise with age.Race/Ethnicity. High blood pressure is more common in Black adults. They also tend to have higher average blood pressure numbers and get high blood pressure earlier in life.Sex. Men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure throughout middle age. But in older adults, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure.Lifestyle. Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.Family history and genetics. High blood pressure often runs in families. Many genes are linked to small increases in high blood pressure risk.Social and economic factors:Research shows that factors such as income, education level, where you live, and the type of job you have may raise your risk of high blood pressure. For example, working early or late shifts can raise your risk.Experiencing discrimination and poverty has been linked to high blood pressure. Also, some research has shown that trauma in childhood may raise the risk of high blood pressure.Certain medicines. Some medicines can raise your blood pressure, including: Certain antidepressantsDecongestants (medicines to relieve a stuffy nose)Hormonal birth control pillsNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are a type of pain reliever Having certain other medical conditions, such as: Some tumorsChronic kidney diseaseDiabetesMetabolic syndromeOverweight and obesitySleep apneaThyroid problems How can I prevent high blood pressure?You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means:Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure.Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, talk to yourprovider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.Getting enough high-quality sleep.If you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You need to get regular medical care and follow your treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

To keep you and your baby healthy, it's important to get treatment for high blood pressure before, during, and after pregnancy.What are the types of high blood pressure in pregnancy?There are different types of high blood pressure in pregnancy:Gestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. If it becomes severe, it can lead to a preterm birth or your baby having a low birth weight. Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia, a more serious type of high blood pressure in pregnancy.Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that starts before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some people may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. Preeclampsia also often includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. The signs may include protein in the urine (pee) and very high blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby. If preeclampsia becomes severe enough to affect your brain function and causes seizures or a coma, it is called eclampsia.In rare cases, preeclampsia symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. If this type of preeclampsia becomes more severe and causes a seizure, it is known as postpartum eclampsia. When a person with preeclampsia or eclampsia has damage to the liver and blood cells, it's called HELLP syndrome. It is rare, but very serious. Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy?You are more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy if you:Had chronic high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease before pregnancyHad high blood pressure or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancyHave obesity Are under age 20 or over age 40Are pregnant with more than one babyAre African AmericanHave a family history of high blood pressure in pregnancyHave certain health conditions, such as diabetes or lupusWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure in pregnancy?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. People usually find out they have high blood pressure when their health care provider measures their blood pressure.Preeclampsia can cause other symptoms, including:Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria).Swelling (edema) in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem.A headache that does not go away.Vision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spots.Pain in your upper right abdomen (belly).Trouble breathing.Eclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output.If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.What problems can high blood pressure in pregnancy cause?High blood pressure in pregnancy can lead to complications such as:Placental abruption, where the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby) separates from the uterus (the place where a baby grows during pregnancy)Poor fetal growth, caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygenPreterm birthYour baby having a low birth weightDamage to your kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systemsA higher risk of heart disease for youHow is high blood pressure in pregnancy diagnosed?Your provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to order some tests. These may include blood tests and other lab tests, such as a test to look for extra protein in your urine.What are the treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy?If you have high blood pressure, you and your baby will be closely monitored to lower the chance of complications. You may need to:Check your blood pressure at home.Keep track of how many times you feel the baby kicking each day.Adjust your physical activity. Talk to your provider about what level of physical activity is right for you.Take medicine to control your blood pressure. Talk to your provider about which medicines are safe for your baby. Take aspirin in the second trimester, if you are at risk of preeclampsia and your provider recommends aspirin.Visit your provider more often to monitor your condition and your baby's growth rate and heart rate.If you have eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or a severe case of preeclampsia, you will most likely need to go to the hospital. Treatment often includes medicines. Your provider may also recommend delivering the baby early. They will make the decision based on:How severe the condition isThe possible risks to you and your babyHow far along the pregnancy isThe goal is to lower the risks to you while giving your baby as much time as possible to mature before delivery. The symptoms of preeclampsia can last after delivery, but they usually go away within 6 weeks.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is high blood pressure?High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is when blood puts too much pressure against the walls of your arteries. Almost half of American adults have high blood pressure, usually with no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack, and kidney disease.What lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure?Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure:Losing weightBeing physically activeManaging stressReducing sodium in your dietAvoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugsGetting enough sleepWhat if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure?Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.How do blood pressure medicines work?The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure.Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If these medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest that you take another type of blood pressure medicine.While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes. Doing both helps keep blood pressure lower than lifestyle changes or medicines alone.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It is an eating plan that is based on research studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). These studies showed that DASH lowers high blood pressure and improves levels of cholesterol. This reduces your risk of getting heart disease.The DASH eating plan:Emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole-grainsIncludes fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oilsLimits foods that are high in saturated fat. These foods include fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils.Limits sugar-sweetened beverages and sweetsAlong with DASH, other lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure. They include staying at a healthy weight, exercising, and not smoking.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Heart disease is the leading cause of the death in the United States. It is also a major cause of disability. But you can take steps to improve your health and help prevent heart disease. The first step is understanding your risk of heart disease. Your risk depends on many factors, some of which are changeable and others that are not. Learning about them and working on the things that you can change can lower your risk of heart disease.What are the heart disease risk factors that I cannot change?There are some risk factors for heart disease that you cannot change:Your age. Your risk of heart disease increases as you get older. The risk is higher in: Men age 45 and olderWomen age 55 and older Your sex. Some risk factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. For example: The hormone estrogen provides women some protection against heart diseaseDiabetes raises the risk of heart disease more in women than in men. Your race or ethnicity. Certain groups have higher risks than others. For example: African Americans are more likely than Whites to die of heart disease, while Hispanic Americans are less likely to die of itAsian Americans as a group have lower rates of heart disease than other groups, but South Asian Americans have higher rates Your family history. You have a greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age, for example if: Your father or brother was diagnosed before age 55Your mother or sister was diagnosed before age 65 What are the heart disease risk factors I can change and what can I do to lower my risk?There are many heart disease risk factors that you can change. If you make these changes, you don't just help protect your heart. You can also improve your overall health and well-being.You may have a lot of changes to make. If you need to, you can make the changes gradually, one at a time. What's most important is that you make them. Depending on your lifestyle, these changes could include:Controlling your blood pressure.High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults, and more often if you have high blood pressure. You can also take steps, including lifestyle changes, to prevent or control high blood pressure.Keeping your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control:High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Lifestyle changes and medicines (if needed) can lower your cholesterol.Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High levels of triglyceride may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women.Staying at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk of heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors, including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.Eating a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats, foods high in sodium (salt), and added sugars. Instead, eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity has many benefits, including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. It's best not to drink, but if you do: Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man.Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman. Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk of heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk of heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. Managing stress.Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a "trigger" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.Managing diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time, high blood glucose (blood sugar) from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.Getting enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk of heart disease. To improve your sleep: If you are an adult, try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.Make sure that you have good sleep habits, such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and creating a good sleeping environment in your bedroom. If you have frequent sleep problems, contact your health care provider. One problem, sleep apnea, causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have sleep apnea, ask your provider about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea, make sure that you get treatment for it.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Your brain is the control center of your body. It controls your thoughts, memory, speech, and movement. It regulates the function of many organs. It's part of your nervous system, which also includes your spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The nervous system sends signals between your brain and the rest of the body. Your nerves take in information from your senses and send it to the brain to be processed. Your brain and nerves also communicate to help you move and to control your body's functions.When the brain is healthy, it works quickly and automatically. But when you have a brain disease, it may affect how well you can function and do your daily activities. Some common brain diseases include:Brain tumors, which can press on nerves and affect brain function.Degenerative nerve diseases, which can affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Types include Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.Encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), which can lead to problems such as vision loss, weakness, and paralysis.Genetic brain disorders, which are caused by changes in genes (also called variants or mutations). These disorders can affect the development and function of the brain.Strokes, which can cause a loss of brain cells and can affect your ability to think clearly.Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can affect brain function. They may range from mild to severe. The effects of a TBI may be temporary or permanent.The symptoms of brain diseases vary widely, depending on the specific problem. In some cases, damage is permanent. In other cases, treatments such as surgery, medicines, or therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies, may cure the disease or improve the symptoms.

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?Atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib or AF, is one of the most common types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They can cause your heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.If you have AFib, your heart beats irregularly and sometimes much faster than normal. Also, your heart's upper and lower chambers do not work together as they should. When this happens, the lower chambers do not fill completely or pump enough blood to your lungs and body. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and a pounding heartbeat.AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. It's very important to treat it, since AFib can put you at risk for stroke and other heart conditions.What causes atrial fibrillation (AFib)?AFib is most often caused by changes to the heart's tissue or the electrical signaling that helps the heartbeat. These changes can happen due to different conditions and factors, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defects, infections, and aging. Sometimes the cause is unknown.Who is more likely to develop atrial fibrillation (AFib)?Anyone can develop AFib, but there are certain things that raise your risk for it:Aging. The risk of atrial fibrillation increases as you get older, especially when you are over age 65.Family history and genetics. AFib can run in families. So can heart disease, which raises your risk of AFib.Some lifestyle choices. Your risk is higher if you drink a lot of alcohol, use certain illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, or smoke.Having certain health conditions, such as: High blood pressureDiabetesHeart failureHeart valve diseasesObesityHyperthyroidismChronic kidney diseaseCOPD and other lung diseasesSleep apnea Race. AFib is more common in people with European ancestry.Recent surgery. You may be at risk of atrial fibrillation in the early days and weeks after surgery on your heart, lungs, or esophagus.What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib)?Some people who have AFib don't have any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do have symptoms, you may only notice them once in a while. Or you may have symptoms that are more frequent. And in some cases, the symptoms might be severe. If you have heart disease, you are more likely to notice your symptoms. And those symptoms could get worse if your heart disease gets worse.The symptoms of AFib can include:Extreme fatigue, which is the most common symptomHeart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast)Trouble breathing, especially when lying down or when exercisingChest painDizziness or faintingLow blood pressureWhat other problems can AFib cause?If AFib is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (complications) such as:StrokeHeart failureBlood clotsSudden cardiac arrest (SCA)Cognitive impairment and dementiaTo help prevent these problems, it's important to contact your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do have AFib, the sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better.How is atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosed?To find out if you have AFib, your provider:Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may haveWill ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had AFibWill do a physical examMay order blood testsWill likely order heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) and echocardiogramMay ask you to wear a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activityWhat are the treatments for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?The treatments for AFib may include:Blood thinner medicines that help prevent blood clots from forming.Medicines to control your heart's rhythm and rate.Following heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Following a heart-healthy eating plan that limits saturated fats, salt, and cholesterol. An example is the DASH eating plan.Limiting or avoiding alcohol, because it can increase your heart rate.Aiming for a healthy weight.Getting regular physical activity.Managing stress.Quitting smoking. Procedures such as: Electrical cardioversion, which restores your heart rhythm using low-energy shocks to your heart.Catheter ablation, which scars the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. The scar tissue blocks the abnormal heart signals. Surgeries such as: Surgery to put in a pacemaker to help control the arrhythmia.A Maze procedure, which creates scar tissue in a maze-like pattern in certain parts of the heart.Left atrial appendage closure, a surgery on a small sac in the muscle wall of your left atrium (the upper left chamber of your heart). It helps prevent blood clots and can reduce your risk of stroke. This surgery is for people who are not able to take blood thinners. Can atrial fibrillation (AFib) be prevented?There are steps you can take to help lower your risk of atrial fibrillation, such as:Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes: Following a heart-healthy eating planLimiting or avoiding alcoholAiming for a healthy weightGetting regular physical activityManaging stressNot smoking Avoiding illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetaminesTaking antiarrhythmic medicine (medicine to treat arrhythmia) if you are having heart surgeryTreating any health conditions that could raise your risk of AFibNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are congenital heart defects?Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. "Congenital" means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.Congenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely.There are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are:Septal defects ("hole in the heart") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heartHeart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heartDefects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heartCongenital heart defects can range from very mild problems that never need treatment to life-threatening problems at birth. The most serious congenital heart defects are called critical congenital heart disease. Babies with these defects usually need surgery in the first year of life. But the symptoms of milder heart defects may not show up until childhood or adulthood.What causes congenital heart defects?Researchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect?Several things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:Your health before and during pregnancy, including: Having diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn't a major risk for heart defects). Carefully controlling your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, before and during pregnancy can lower your baby's risk of congenital heart defects.Having phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods. If you have PKU, eating a low-protein diet before getting pregnant can lower your baby's risk of having a congenital heart defect.Having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy.Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including: Smoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker).Certain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne. If you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, talk with your health care provider about all the medicines you take.Your family history and genetics. In most cases, congenital heart defects don't run in families. But your chance of having a baby with a congenital heart defect does go up if you or the other parent has a congenital heart defect, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect.What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects?Congenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.Common signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It happens when there isn't enough oxygen in the blood.Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings.Poor blood flow.Fast or difficult breathing.Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats.What other problems do congenital heart defects cause?Congenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.Children with congenital heart defects are more likely to:Be smaller than other childrenHave problems or delays in mental, and emotional growth, and behavior, such as: Speech and language problemsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) People with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valvesArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatHeart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the bodyPulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungsKidney and liver diseaseHow are congenital heart defects diagnosed?Before a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.During the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.To diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including: A physical exam.Certain heart tests to see how the heart is working.Genetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect.What are the treatments for congenital heart defects?Treatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart. A catheterization uses a thin tube guided through a vein and into the heart.Heart surgery may be needed to: Repair defects in the heart and blood vessels.Repair or replace a heart valve.Place a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood.Do a heart transplant Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus.All children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.Some people may need several heart surgeries or catheterizations over the years. They may also need to take medicines to help their hearts work as well as possible.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL CONDITION: Heart Valve Diseases

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are heart valve diseases?Heart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well.Your heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases.What are the types of heart valve diseases?Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems:Regurgitation, or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve.Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body.Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through.Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis.What causes heart valve diseases?Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart.Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases?Your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if:You are older. With age, the heart valves can become thick and stiff.You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include: Rheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage.Endocarditis. This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream.A heart attack.Heart failure.Coronary artery disease, especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body).High blood pressure.High blood cholesterol.Diabetes.Obesity and overweight.Lack of physical activity. A family history of early heart disease:A father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55.A mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65.You were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems.What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases?Many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as:Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)FatigueSwelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neckChest pain when you're physically activeArrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatDizziness or faintingIf you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.What other problems can heart valve diseases cause?When the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body. Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart can lead to:Heart failureStrokeBlood clotsSudden cardiac arrest or deathHow is heart valve disease diagnosed?Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases.The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests.What are the treatments for heart valve diseases?Most heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include:Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping wellHeart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditionsSurgery to repair or replace a valveIt's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help prevent future heart problems.There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement.In some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves:Biologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer.Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. And your risk of endocarditis (a heart infection) is higher than with a biologic valve.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Lifestyle changes and medicines (if needed) can lower your cholesterol.Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High levels of triglyceride may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women.Staying at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk of heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors, including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.Eating a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats, foods high in sodium (salt), and added sugars. Instead, eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity has many benefits, including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. It's best not to drink, but if you do: Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man.Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman. Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk of heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk of heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. Managing stress.Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a "trigger" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.Managing diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time, high blood glucose (blood sugar) from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.Getting enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk of heart disease. To improve your sleep: If you are an adult, try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.Make sure that you have good sleep habits, such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and creating a good sleeping environment in your bedroom. If you have frequent sleep problems, contact your health care provider. One problem, sleep apnea, causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have sleep apnea, ask your provider about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea, make sure that you get treatment for it.

MEDICAL CONDITION: Coronary Artery Disease
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage. Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is diabetes?Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What is diabetic heart disease?Diabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.Over time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:Coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.Heart failure. With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.Cardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.Who is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease?Diabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including:High blood pressureHigh blood levels of LDL "bad" cholesterolHigh triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL "good" cholesterolYour risk for heart disease is also higher if youAre maleSmokeHave obesityHave too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight: For men, that's a waist more than 40 inchesFor women, that's a waist more than 35 inches Have a family history of heart diseaseHave chronic kidney diseaseWhat are the symptoms of diabetic heart disease?In the early stages, heart disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. But if your heart disease worsens, you can have symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. They might include:Shortness of breathFatigueDizziness or faintingArrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)Swollen feet and anklesChest painIt's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider.How is diabetic heart disease diagnosed?To find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will:Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may haveAsk about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart diseaseDo a physical examLikely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease, including: Blood tests to check your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levelsA blood-pressure checkHeart tests, if needed Depending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care. If you do have heart disease, treatment will depend on the type of heart disease you have.How can I prevent diabetic heart disease?You may be able to prevent heart disease or keep it from getting worse by working with your provider to:Control your blood sugar levelsManage other conditions you may have that can raise your risk for heart disease Take any medicines your provider prescribedMake heart-healthy habits part of your daily lifeFollow a healthy eating plan for diabetesNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is heart disease?Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease in both men and women. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to:Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flowHeart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flowHeart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needsArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatHow does heart disease affect women?In the United States, heart disease is the number one cause of death in women. But women are often not diagnosed with heart disease as quickly as men are. That's because:Women are more likely than men to have "silent" heart disease, meaning that they don't have symptoms.Health care providers may not recognize heart disease in women because women's symptoms may be different from men's symptoms.Women are more likely than men to have certain types of heart disease that can be harder to diagnose.A delay in diagnosis may mean a delay in medical care that could help prevent serious problems, such as a heart attack. That's why it's important to learn about your risk for heart disease, the symptoms in women, and how to keep your heart healthy.What types of heart disease do women get?Women can get any type of heart disease. Like men, the most common type of heart disease among women is coronary artery disease. But there are certain types of heart disease which are less common, but affect women more often than men:Coronary microvascular disease - Chest pain from spasms (sudden tightening) in the smallest arteries of the heart that pinch off blood flow. It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases. This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests.Broken heart syndrome - Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It's caused by the stress of powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you're healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn't cause any lasting damage.Variant angina - A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries. The pain usually happens in a pattern during sleep. Variant angina rarely causes a heart attack.Which women are more likely to develop heart disease?Your risk for developing heart disease increases with:Menopause. Women can develop heart disease at any age, but your risk increases after your periods stop, usually by age 55. Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female hormone) which helps protect against heart disease. That's why women generally develop coronary artery disease 10 years later than men. During and after menopause, estrogen levels drop and your risk for heart diseases goes up. If your periods stop before age 40, your risk will be higher than other women your age.Family history of heart disease. Your risk for heart disease may be higher if your: Mother or sister had heart disease before age 65.Father or brother had heart disease before age 55. Problems during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure.Use of hormonal birth control (pills, patches, or vaginal rings with estrogen and progesterone).Endometriosis.Polycystic ovary syndrome.Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.Metabolic syndrome.Mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, or depression.Health risks from a lack physical activity.Obesity or being overweight.Diabetes.Low HDL cholesterol levels.Mild to moderate high blood pressure.Smoking.If you have one or more risks for heart disease, ask your health care provider for help understanding your risk level. Ask if you need any heart tests to help catch heart disease early.What are the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack in women?When women have symptoms of heart disease, they may include:Pain or discomfort in the chest that may be dull and heavy or sharpPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly, or backNausea or vomitingUnusual fatigueShortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) during physical activityWomen who have coronary artery disease are more likely than men to have chest pain when resting or doing daily activities, rather than during exercise. They're also more likely than men to feel chest pain from mental stress.Symptoms of a heart attack in women may also be different than in men. Chest pain is the most common symptom for both sexes. It may feel like crushing or squeezing. But women are somewhat less likely than men to have chest pain.During a heart attack, women may feel:Pressure or tightness in the chestPain in the upper back, arms, neck, jaw or throatDizzinessUnusual fatigueIndigestion, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting Stomach painShortness of breathHeart attacks usually don't look like the sudden, dramatic events we see in the movies. The symptoms may be mild or strong. They may start slowly. They can stop and then come back.Can heart disease in women be prevented?You can help lower your risk by:Learning how to prevent heart disease and making heart-healthy habits part of your daily life.Asking your provider about your personal risk for heart disease and the best way to manage your heart health.Remember, women can have heart disease without symptoms. But if you pay attention to your risk for heart disease, you can take action to prevent problems or keep them from getting worse.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL CONDITION: Congenital Heart Defects
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are congenital heart defects?Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. "Congenital" means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.Congenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely.There are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are:Septal defects ("hole in the heart") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heartHeart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heartDefects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heartCongenital heart defects can range from very mild problems that never need treatment to life-threatening problems at birth. The most serious congenital heart defects are called critical congenital heart disease. Babies with these defects usually need surgery in the first year of life. But the symptoms of milder heart defects may not show up until childhood or adulthood.What causes congenital heart defects?Researchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect?Several things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:Your health before and during pregnancy, including: Having diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn't a major risk for heart defects). Carefully controlling your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, before and during pregnancy can lower your baby's risk of congenital heart defects.Having phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods. If you have PKU, eating a low-protein diet before getting pregnant can lower your baby's risk of having a congenital heart defect.Having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy.Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including: Smoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker).Certain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne. If you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, talk with your health care provider about all the medicines you take.Your family history and genetics. In most cases, congenital heart defects don't run in families. But your chance of having a baby with a congenital heart defect does go up if you or the other parent has a congenital heart defect, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect.What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects?Congenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.Common signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It happens when there isn't enough oxygen in the blood.Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings.Poor blood flow.Fast or difficult breathing.Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats.What other problems do congenital heart defects cause?Congenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.Children with congenital heart defects are more likely to:Be smaller than other childrenHave problems or delays in mental, and emotional growth, and behavior, such as: Speech and language problemsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) People with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valvesArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatHeart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the bodyPulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungsKidney and liver diseaseHow are congenital heart defects diagnosed?Before a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.During the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.To diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including: A physical exam.Certain heart tests to see how the heart is working.Genetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect.What are the treatments for congenital heart defects?Treatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart. A catheterization uses a thin tube guided through a vein and into the heart.Heart surgery may be needed to: Repair defects in the heart and blood vessels.Repair or replace a heart valve.Place a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood.Do a heart transplant Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus.All children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.Some people may need several heart surgeries or catheterizations over the years. They may also need to take medicines to help their hearts work as well as possible.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Heart diseases are the number one killer in the United States. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have heart disease, it is important to find it early, when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your health care provider will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors, and medical history.Cardiac CatheterizationCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your provider puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The provider can use the catheter to:Do a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your provider takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your provider to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries.Take samples of your blood and heart muscle.Examine your heart valves.Do procedures such as angioplasty or minor heart surgeries to repair congenital heart defects or replace heart valves.Cardiac CT ScanA cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of your whole heart. This test can help providers detect or evaluate various heart problems, including:Coronary artery diseaseCalcium buildup in the coronary arteriesCongenital heart defectsProblems with the aorta (the main artery that carries blood away from the heart)Problems with heart function and valvesPericardial diseasesBefore you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures.Cardiac MRICardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your provider figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your provider decide the best way to treat heart problems such as:Congenital heart defectsCoronary artery diseaseHeart valve problemsPericarditisCardiac tumorsDamage from a heart attackThe MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.Chest X-RayA chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.Coronary AngiographyCoronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Providers use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.You usually have a cardiac catheterization to inject the dye into your coronary arteries. Then the provider will take special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your provider study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.EchocardiographyEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Providers use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are.There are several different types of echocardiography. For transthoracic echocardiography (the most common type), a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) across your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG)An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia, and heart failure.For the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.Stress TestingStress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure.For the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Before or after the test, you might also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to craeate pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL CONDITION: Heart Failure
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is heart failure?Heart failure means that your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop beating. But without enough blood flow, your organs may not work well, which can cause serious problems.Heart failure can affect one or both sides of your heart:With right-sided heart failure, your heart is too weak to pump enough blood to your lungs to get oxygen.With left-sided heart failure, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to your body. This happens when the left side of your heart becomes either: Too weak to pump enough blood.Too thick or stiff to relax and fill with enough blood.Left-sided heart failure is more common than right-sided heart failure.What causes heart failure?Heart failure can start suddenly after a medical condition or injury damages your heart muscle. But in most cases, heart failure develops slowly from long-term medical conditions.Conditions that can cause heart failure include:Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)CardiomyopathyCongenital heart defects or other types of heart diseases that you are born withCoronary artery diseaseEndocarditisHeart attackHeart valve diseasesHigh blood pressureA blood clot in your lungDiabetesCertain severe lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)ObesityOver time, left-sided heart failure can lead to right-sided heart failure.Who is more likely to develop heart failure?Heart failure can happen at any age. It happens to both men and women, but men often develop it at a younger age than women. Your chance of developing heart failure increases if:You're 65 years old or older. Aging can weaken and stiffen your heart muscle.Your family health history includes relatives who have or have had heart failure.You have changes in your genes that affect your heart tissue.You have habits that can harm your heart, including: SmokingEating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt)Having an inactive lifestyleAlcohol use disorder (AUD)Illegal drug useYou have other medical conditions that can affect your heart, including: Any heart or blood vessel conditions, including high blood pressureSerious lung diseasesInfection, such as HIV or COVID-19ObesityDiabetesSleep apneaChronic kidney diseaseAnemiaThyroid diseaseIron overload diseaseCancer treatments that can harm your heart, such as radiation and chemotherapyYou are African American. African Americans are more likely to develop heart failure and have more serious cases at younger ages than people of other races. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of heart failure.What are the symptoms of heart failure?The symptoms of heart failure depend on which side of your heart is affected and how serious your condition has become. Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and fluid buildup in your body.Fluid buildup happens because the flow of blood through your heart is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your heart.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in the late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Some people do have episodes of depression that start in the spring or summer, but that is a lot less common. Symptoms of SAD may include:SadnessGloomy outlookFeeling hopeless, worthless, and irritableLoss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoyLow energyDifficulty sleeping or oversleepingCarbohydrate cravings and weight gainThoughts of death or suicideSAD is more common in women, young people, and those who live far from the equator.

Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, and not enough vitamin D.The main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright, artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

MEDICAL INFORMATION:

It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives.But antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.Are antidepressants used for other conditions?A health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety, chronic pain, or insomnia. Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions.What are the different types of antidepressants?There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems.Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groupsIf these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people.Which type of antidepressant is right for me?Our bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone. You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you.Your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first. You'll consider questions such as:Which symptoms bother you most? Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping.What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs.Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too.Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment.Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding? If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby.How long do antidepressants take to work?Antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job.Sometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health.How long will I need to take an antidepressant?When an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.What are the side effects of antidepressants?Not everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine.The most common side effects from antidepressants include:Nausea and vomitingWeight gainDiarrheaSleepinessSexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sexWhen thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options.If you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own.If you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away.In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens.What can I do to take antidepressants safely?Antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too.Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine.Talk with your provider if side effects bother you.Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant.NIH: National Institute of Mental Health

These factors vary from person to person, and they include:StressAnxietyHormonal changes in womenBright or flashing lightsLoud noisesStrong smellsMedicinesToo much or not enough sleepSudden changes in weather or environmentOverexertion (too much physical activity)TobaccoCaffeine or caffeine withdrawalSkipped mealsMedication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:AlcoholChocolateAged cheesesMonosodium glutamate (MSG)Some fruits and nutsFermented or pickled goodsYeastCured or processed meatsWho is at risk for migraines?About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you:Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines.Have a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.Have other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.What are the symptoms of migraines?There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is pneumonia?Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. It causes the air sacs of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. It can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health.What causes pneumonia?Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause pneumonia.Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:Streptococcus pneumoniaeLegionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' diseaseMycoplasma pneumoniaeChlamydia pneumoniaeHaemophilus influenzaeViruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)Some common cold and flu virusesSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include:Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)Coccidioidomycosis, which causes valley feverHistoplasmosisCryptococcusWho is at risk for pneumonia?Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain factors can increase your risk:Age; the risk is higher for children who are age 2 and under and adults age 65 and olderExposure to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumesLifestyle habits, such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, and malnourishmentBeing in a hospital, especially if you are in the ICU. Being sedated and/or on a ventilator raises the risk even more.Having a lung diseaseHaving a weakened immune systemHave trouble coughing or swallowing, from a stroke or other conditionRecently being sick with a cold or the fluWhat are the symptoms of pneumonia?The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include:FeverChillsCough, usually with phlegm (a slimy substance from deep in your lungs)Shortness of breathChest pain when you breathe or coughNausea and/or vomitingDiarrheaThe symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless.Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.What other problems can pneumonia cause?Sometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as:Bacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead to septic shock.Lung abscesses, which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungsPleural disorders, which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity.Kidney failureRespiratory failureHow is pneumonia diagnosed?Sometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose. This is because it can cause some of the same symptoms as a cold or the flu. It may take time for you to realize that you have a more serious condition.Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptomsA physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscopeVarious tests, such as A chest x-rayBlood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infectionA Blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream If you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, you may also have more tests, such as:Sputum test, which checks for bacteria in a sample of your sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs).Chest CT scan to see how much of your lungs is affected. It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions.Pleural fluid culture, which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural spacePulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your bloodBronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airwaysWhat are the treatments for pneumonia?Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is:Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia.In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumoniaAntifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumoniaYou may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen therapy.It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more.Can pneumonia be prevented?Vaccines can help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria or the flu virus. Having good hygiene, not smoking, and having a healthy lifestyle may also help prevent pneumonia.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is Legionnaires' Disease? Legionnaires' disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. The disease got its name when a group of people at an American Legion convention became ill with this type of pneumonia.Legionella is found naturally in freshwater, such as lakes and rivers. It can also be found in soil. But people usually only get sick from it when if it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These systems can include hot tubs, fountains, and the plumbing systems of large buildings, such as hotels or nursing homes.Legionella can also cause Pontiac fever. This is a milder, flu-like illness that doesn't infect your lungs.What causes Legionnaires' disease?You usually can't get infected by drinking water that contains the bacteria unless you aspirate it (accidentally breathe the water into your lungs). The bacteria don't spread from person to person. Disease outbreaks happen when many people are exposed to the same water source that contains the bacteria.Who is more likely to develop Legionnaires' disease?Most healthy people who come in contact with the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to develop an infection if you:Are over the age of 50Are a current or former smokerHave a chronic (long-lasting) disease such as diabetes or kidney failureHave a chronic lung disease such as COPD or emphysemaHave a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV or cancer or are taking medicines that suppress your immune systemLive in a long-term care facilityHave recently stayed in a hospital or had surgery requiring anesthesiaWhat are the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease? The symptoms usually show up 2 to 14 days after you were exposed to Legionella bacteria. Most of the symptoms are similar to those of other types of pneumonia. But Legionnaires' disease may also cause gastrointestinal symptoms and mental changes.The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease may include:CoughHigh feverChillsHeadacheChest painShortness of breathFatigueNausea and vomitingDiarrheaConfusionWhat other problems can Legionnaires' disease cause?Legionnaires' disease can cause life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure, kidney failure, and sepsis.About 1 out of every 10 people who get sick with Legionnaires' disease will die from complications of the illness.How is Legionnaires' disease diagnosed?To find out if you have Legionnaires' disease, your health care provider will probably order a chest x-ray to see if you have pneumonia. If you do have it, lab tests such as a urine or sputum test can check for the Legionella bacteria. Your provider may also order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to the bacteria.What are the treatments for Legionnaires' disease?If you have Legionnaires' disease, you will likely need care in a hospital. The treatment is with antibiotics. Most people will recover, especially if they were healthy when they got the disease. Getting treatment early can increase the chances of getting better.Can Legionnaires' disease be prevented?You can lower your risk of getting Legionnaires' disease if you:Clean all your water-related devices regularly. This could include portable humidifiers, water heaters, air conditioners, and nasal rinses.If you haven't used your faucets and showerheads for a week or more, flush them by letting the hot and cold faucets run for at least two minutes before use.Avoid exposure to water sources such as decorative foundations or hot tubs if you don't know how well they are maintained.Use windshield cleaner in your wiper fluid tank in your car instead of water.Ask about how well your buildings' water systems are maintained.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are the health effects of smoking?There's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every organ of the body, even some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes many cancers and other health problems. It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States.Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include:Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, colon and rectum, and cervix. It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lung diseases. Smoking is the most common cause of COPD. It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia.Cardiovascular diseases. Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure. Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke.Vision problems. Smoking can raise your risk of cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD).You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant. Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking.What are the health risks of secondhand smoke?Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke, they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight.Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous?Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes.E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals.Smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions.Why should I quit?Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include:Lower heart rate and blood pressureLess carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen)Better circulationLess coughing and wheezingQuitting smoking can be challenging, but it is so important for your health. Contact your health care provider if you need help quitting.

This can lead to sepsis, a very serious immune response to infection.Bone infections.Endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.Food poisoning.Pneumonia.Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria.What causes staph infections?Some people carry staph bacteria on their skin or in their noses, but they do not get an infection. But if they get a cut or wound, the bacteria can enter the body and cause an infection.Staph bacteria can spread from person to person. They can also spread on objects, such as towels, clothing, door handles, athletic equipment, and remotes. If you have staph and do not handle food properly when you are preparing it, you can also spread staph to others.Who is more likely to get a staph infection?Anyone can develop a staph infection, but certain people are more likely to get one, including those who:Have a chronic condition such as diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, eczema, and lung diseaseHave a weakened immune system, such as from HIV, medicines to prevent organ rejection, or chemotherapyHad surgeryAre in the hospitalUse a catheter, breathing tube, or feeding tubeHave an implanted device, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint or heart valveHave burns, especially if they are deep or cover a large area of the bodyAre on dialysisInject illegal drugsDo contact sports, since you may have skin-to-skin contact with others or share equipmentWhat are the symptoms of staph infections?The symptoms of a staph infection depend on the type of infection:Skin infections can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes there is pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo, which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis, a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot.Bone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever.Endocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, and fatigue.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is bird flu?Birds, just like people, can get the flu. Another name for bird flu is avian influenza. The viruses that cause bird flu normally only infect birds, including chickens, other poultry, and wild birds such as ducks. But sometimes the viruses can infect other animals and, in rare cases, people.A few types of these viruses have caused most of the infections in people. They are the H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses. These infections in people have mainly been in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. Although it's very rare, there have also been some infections in people in the United States.How do you get bird flu?The most common ways you can get bird flu are from:Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after handling infected live or dead birdsTouching surfaces or handling items contaminated by bird flu viruses and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouthBreathing in droplets or dust contaminated with the virusIt's also possible (but very rare) to get bird flu from:Another type of animal who has bird flu. Bird flu can also infect many other animals, including some dogs, cats, certain wild and zoo animals, and livestock such as cattle. These animals can then spread the flu to people.Another person.Eating poultry, eggs, and beef that were not properly handled and cooked.Drinking raw milk.Who is more likely to get bird flu?Certain people may be more likely to get bird flu, including:Poultry workersAnimal handlersWildlife biologistsDisease control workersResearch laboratory workersVeterinariansPeople who travel to countries where bird flu is presentWhat are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?Sometimes bird flu doesn't cause any symptoms. But if you do feel sick, your symptoms can range from mild to severe. Often, the symptoms are similar to the (seasonal) flu, such as:Fever (but not everyone has a fever)CoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesFatigueHeadachesEye redness (conjunctivitis)Trouble breathingDiarrheaPeople with severe illness from bird flu may have pneumonia and might need to be hospitalized.How is bird flu diagnosed?Laboratory testing is used to diagnose bird flu. It's usually done with a nasal or throat swab. This testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness.For people who are severely ill, health care providers may do testing of a different sample, such as fluid taken during a bronchoalveolar lavage or other procedure.What are the treatments for bird flu?Bird flu is treated with antiviral medicines. It's important to get them as soon as possible. The medicines may make your illness less severe.You may also be given antiviral medicines if you were exposed to a person or animal who has the virus. This may help prevent you from getting sick.Can bird flu be prevented?There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government has developed a virus that is similar to some H5N1 viruses. The virus could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed.It's important to take precautions to prevent bird flu:If you have a job or pastime that puts you in contact with birds or other animals, make sure to use proper protective equipment.Otherwise try to avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals.Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other animals.Since it's possible to get bird flu through some foods, make sure to handle and cook your food safely and avoid raw milk.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery.What are the types of stroke?There are two types of stroke:Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic.Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.Another condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a "mini-stroke." TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but having a TIA puts you at much higher risk of having a stroke.Who is at risk for a stroke?Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include:High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke.Diabetes.Heart diseases.Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke.Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure.A personal or family history of stroke or TIAAge. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older.Race and ethnicity. People who are African Americans or Hispanic have a higher risk of stroke.There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as:Alcohol and illegal drug useNot getting enough physical activityHigh cholesterolUnhealthy dietHaving obesityWhat are the symptoms of a stroke?The symptoms of a stroke often happen quickly. They include:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeThe F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke. Think "FAST" and look for:Face drooping on one side when smiling.Arm weakness occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward.Speech is slurred or strange.Time to call 911.If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Every minute counts during a stroke.How are strokes diagnosed?To make a diagnosis, your health care provider willAsk about your symptoms and medical historyDo a physical exam, including a check of Your mental alertnessYour coordination and balanceAny numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legsAny trouble speaking and seeing clearly Run some tests, which may include Diagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI.Heart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography. What are the treatments for stroke?Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are:Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happeningPost-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the strokePrevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another strokeAcute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines:You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery.If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger.If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery.Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it:If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines.If an aneurysm is the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done throughSurgeryInjecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flowRadiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVMStroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.Can strokes be prevented?If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke:Eating a heart-healthy dietAiming for a healthy weightManaging stressGetting regular physical activityQuitting smokingManaging your blood pressure and cholesterol levelsIf these changes aren't enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

What is an ischemic stroke?A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.There are two main types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the more common type. An ischemic stroke happens when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain. Quick treatment can save a life and improve the chances of recovery.What causes an ischemic stroke?Ischemic strokes are usually caused by one or more of the following:A blood clot. A clot can form in an artery that supplies the brain (thrombosis), or it can travel from another part of the body (embolism).Atherosclerosis. A disease in which plaque, a sticky substance made up of cholesterol, fat, and other substances, builds up inside your arteries.Irregular heart rhythms. Conditions like atrial fibrillation can cause clots to form in the heart, which may travel to the brain.Other heart and blood conditions. Such as heart valve diseases or sickle cell disease.A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. It usually lasts a few minutes. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.What are the symptoms of ischemic stroke?Symptoms of stroke often happen suddenly. They include:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeIf you think someone is having a stroke, the F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for.

Other heart tests may be done to help find the cause of the stroke.How is an ischemic stroke treated?It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. The most common treatments include:Medicines such as blood thinners or thrombolytics (which break up and dissolve existing clots) may be used to prevent or treat ischemic stroke.Surgery or stenting may be used to open narrowed arteries or remove plaque build-up from the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain.After treatment, rehabilitation can help you regain lost skills and independence. Your provider may also order other medicines to manage your blood pressure,cholesterol, or other health problems such as diabetes that may increase your risk for stroke.Can an ischemic stroke be prevented?The best way to prevent stroke is by making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your risk. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your provider may prescribe medicine to help manage your risk factors.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is a hemorrhagic stroke?A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.There are two main types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. A hemorrhagic stroke is less common but often more severe. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding (hemorrhage) in or around the brain. This bleeding increases pressure inside the skull and damages brain tissue. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.What are the types of hemorrhagic stroke?Hemorrhagic strokes are classified by where the bleeding happens:Intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs directly into the brain tissue. This is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke.Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs in the space between the brain and the thin layers of tissues covering it. This often happens when a weak spot in an artery (called an aneurysm) bursts on the brain's surface.What causes hemorrhagic stroke?Common causes include:Aneurysm. A bulge or "ballooning" in a weakened artery wall that can burst.Arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A tangled group of abnormal blood vessels that can rupture inside the brain.High blood pressure (hypertension). Over time, it can weaken blood vessel walls and increase the risk of them breaking open.Head trauma. Brain injury can cause bleeding.What are the symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke?Stroke symptoms often happen suddenly. They include:Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeThe F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke.

What is stroke rehabilitation?Stroke rehabilitation is a program for people who have had a stroke. A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. It can help with movement, speech, strength, and daily living skills. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible.Who needs stroke rehabilitation?Rehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities needed for daily life. Stroke rehabilitation is recommended for anyone affected by stroke. Most people who take part in a treatment program recover better than those who don't.The effects of a stroke depend on the parts of your brain that were affected. Your health care provider may recommend care based on your needs.The types of disabilities a stroke can cause include:Paralysis or problems controlling movementPain or other problems with your sensesProblems using or understanding languageProblems with thinking and memoryDifficulty with controlling or expressing emotionsWhen should stroke rehabilitation begin?The sooner you begin rehabilitation, the more likely you are to regain lost skills and abilities. Treatment may start while you're still in the hospital. Most likely it will begin within 24 to 48 hours after the stroke.What does stroke rehabilitation include?The goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals vary for each person. Your treatment plan will depend on what part of your body or type of ability was affected by the stroke. It may include teaching you new ways to work with disabilities, such as using assistive devices to make it easier to do your usual activities.A plan for stroke rehabilitation can involve many kinds of health professionals. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and make a treatment plan. The types of treatments can include:Speech-language therapy. To help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing, and swallowing.Physical therapy. To help you relearn movement and coordination skills, regain strength, and stretch your muscles.Occupational therapy.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke that lasts only a few minutes. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly blocked. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms, but do not last as long. They happen suddenly, and include:Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the bodyConfusion or trouble speaking or understanding speechTrouble seeing in one or both eyesDifficulty walkingDizzinessLoss of balance or coordinationMost symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may last for up to 24 hours. Because you cannot tell if these symptoms are from a TIA or a stroke, you should go to the hospital right away.TIAs are often a warning sign for future strokes. Taking medicine, such as blood thinners, may reduce your risk of a stroke. Your doctor might also recommend surgery. You can also help lower your risk by having a healthy lifestyle. This includes not smoking, not drinking too much, eating a healthy diet, and exercising. It is also important to control other health problems, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Your body normally cools itself by sweating. During hot weather, especially when it is very humid, sweating just isn't enough to cool you off. Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness.Most heat illnesses happen when you stay out in the heat too long. Exercising and working outside in high heat can also lead to heat illness. Older adults, young children, and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Taking certain medicines or drinking alcohol can also raise your risk.Heat-related illnesses include:Heat stroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 °F (41 °C) in minutes. Symptoms include dry skin, a rapid, strong pulse, dizziness, nausea, and confusion. If you see any of these signs, get medical help right away.Heat exhaustion - an illness that can happen after several days of exposure to high temperatures and not enough fluids. Symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing, and a fast, weak pulse. If it is not treated, it can turn into heat stroke.Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise. You usually get them in your abdomen, arms, or legs.Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating. It is more common in young children.You can lower your risk of heat illness by drinking fluids to prevent dehydration, replacing lost salt and minerals, and limiting your time in the heat.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is heart disease?Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's a type of cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease.What are the types of heart disease?There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, called congenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime.Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems:Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flowHeart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flowHeart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needsArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeatOther types of heart diseases may affect your heart valves or heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).What causes heart diseases?The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases.Who is more likely to develop heart diseases?There are many different factors that can make you more likely to develop heart disease. Some of these factors you can change, but others you cannot.Age. Your risk of heart disease goes up as you get older.Sex. Some factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men.Family history and genetics. A family history of early heart disease raises your risk. And research has shown that some genes are linked to a higher risk of certain heart diseases.Race/ethnicity. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. However, certain groups have higher risks than others. This includes Black people, White people, and American Indian/Alaska Native people.Lifestyle habits. Over time, unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk of heart disease. These can include: Eating a diet high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and salt.Not getting enough physical activity.Drinking too much alcohol.Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.Too much stress. Having other medical conditions can raise your risk of heart diseases. These conditions include: High blood pressure.High cholesterol levels.Diabetes.Obesity.Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.Chronic kidney disease.Metabolic syndrome. What are the symptoms of heart disease?Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. You may not have symptoms at first. In some cases, you may not know you have heart disease until you have a complication such as a heart attack.How are heart diseases diagnosed?To find out if you have heart disease, your health care provider will:Ask about your medical history, including your symptomsAsk about your family health history, including relatives who have had heart diseaseDo a physical examLikely run heart tests and blood testsIn some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.What are the treatments for heart disease?Treatment plans for heart disease depend on the type of heart disease you have, how serious your symptoms are, and what other health conditions you have.

MEDICAL CONDITION: Carotid Artery Disease
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Your carotid arteries are two large blood vessels in your neck. They supply your brain and head with blood. If you have carotid artery disease, the arteries become narrow or blocked, usually because of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, which is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.Carotid artery disease is serious because it can block the blood flow to your brain, causing a stroke. Too much plaque in the artery can cause a blockage. You can also have a blockage when a piece of plaque or a blood clot breaks off the wall of an artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of your brain's smaller arteries.Carotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms until the blockage or narrowing is severe. One sign may be a bruit (whooshing sound) that your doctor hears when listening to your artery with a stethoscope. Another sign is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a "mini-stroke." A TIA is like a stroke, but it only lasts a few minutes, and the symptoms usually go away within an hour. Stroke is another sign.Imaging tests can confirm whether you have carotid artery disease.Treatments may include:Healthy lifestyle changesMedicinesCarotid endarterectomy, surgery to remove the plaqueAngioplasty, a procedure to place a balloon and stent into the artery to open it and hold it openNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is aphasia?Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language.The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia:Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts.Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean.Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events.In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills.What causes aphasia?Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from:Stroke, which is the most common cause of aphasiaBrain tumorBrain infection or inflammationBrain injuryOther brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementiaWho is more likely to develop aphasia?Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time.How is aphasia diagnosed?If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually:Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands.Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include: MRICT scan If imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders).What are the treatments for aphasia?Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible.Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:Using simpler languageIncluding the person with aphasia in conversationsRepeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearlyHow much a person recovers depends on many things, including:What caused the brain injuryWhat part of the brain was hurtHow badly and how much of the brain was hurtThe age and health of the personCan aphasia be prevented?You can help prevent aphasia by:Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having: A strokeHeart diseaseVascular disease (problems with your blood vessels) Protecting your brain from injury: Wearing the right helmet for sports safety, such as when riding a bikeTaking action to prevent fallsAlways wearing your seatbelt and driving safely NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Each year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.The most common symptoms in men and women are:Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is juvenile arthritis?Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint inflammation (swelling), pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. It can affect any joint, but it is more common in the knees, hands, and feet.JA can affect your child's growth and development, and in some cases, it can also affect other organs. Finding JA early and starting treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce joint damage.Who is more likely to get juvenile arthritis?There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children. The most common type of JA in children under age 16 is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). There are multiple types of JIA. Symptoms and the number of joints affected help determine the type. Some types of JIA are more common in girls.What causes juvenile arthritis?The exact cause of JA is unknown. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's tissues.What are the symptoms of juvenile arthritis?Symptoms can vary depending on the type of JA. The symptoms of most types include joint pain, swelling, warmth, and stiffness. Your child may not complain of pain or stiffness, but one early sign of JA may be limping or clumsiness in the morning or after resting. Larger joints, such as the knee, may be swollen.Certain types of JA can cause a high fever, swollen lymph nodes, a rash, growth problems, or eye inflammation in some children. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away.How is juvenile arthritis diagnosed?There is no single test for JA, so it can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may:Ask about medical history and symptoms.Do a physical exam.Order blood tests or imaging studies.What are the treatments for juvenile arthritis?A team of providers usually treats JA. Treatment will depend on your child's age, the type of JA, and how bad it is. Treatment can include medicines and physical therapy to help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include:Intense pain in the jointJoint redness and swellingChills and feverInability to move the area with the infected jointOne type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is rheumatoid arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. RA is an autoimmune disease. Although it is most common in the wrist and fingers, this disease can cause your immune system to attack any joint tissue. The inflammation (swelling) that comes with RA can also affect other body parts. Inflammation could cause medical issues in your eyes, skin, heart, nerves, blood, or lungs.RA differs from osteoarthritis, a common arthritis that often comes with age. RA affects the lining of your joints and damages the tissue that covers the ends of the bones in a joint. Eventually, this might cause your joints to not work as well.There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help you manage symptoms, reduce joint damage, and lead a productive life.Who is more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age, but your risk increases as you become an older adult. Your chance of developing RA can also increase if:You're a woman. Women are more likely to get RA than men.You have a family history. If a member of your family has RA, you're more likely to get the disease.You're a smoker.Smoking over a long period of time increases your risk of getting RA and how serious the disease can be.You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting RA. These include obesity, gum disease, and lung disease.What causes rheumatoid arthritis?No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. A few things that might play a part in getting RA include:Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis, but not everyone with these genes gets RA.The environment, which includes things such as cigarette smoke, sometimes triggers RA symptoms.Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Researchers think that sex hormones might play a role in getting RA. Women are more likely to develop the disease, and RA symptoms may change during and after pregnancy.What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?Your immune system may start turning against your body's joints and tissues years before you notice any symptoms of RA. The changes from this type of immune malfunction usually settle in your joints.RA affects people differently. You might have the disease for only a short time, or your symptoms might come and go. The severe form can be chronic (long-lasting) and may last a lifetime.Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:Joint pain or stiffness when moving. This is usually worse in the morning or after inactivity. RA usually affects both joints. If one of your hands or knees is affected, so is the other.Joint tenderness, redness, and warmth.Joint swelling may make daily activities hard. These could include things such as combing your hair, buttoning your clothes, or bending your knees.Fatigue, fever, and a loss of appetite.Hard bumps (rheumatoid nodules) under your skin near the joints.How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed?There's no single test for rheumatoid arthritis. The disease develops over time. At first, you may only have a few symptoms, making it hard to diagnose RA in its early stages. To find out if you have RA, your health care provider may:Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms.Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had RA.Do a physical exam, which includes checking your joints, looking for rashes or nodules, and listening to your chest for signs of inflammation in your lungs.Order blood tests or imaging studies (x-ray or ultrasound) to make sure other health conditions aren't causing your symptoms since they may be like other types of arthritis and joint conditions.Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care.What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis?There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help prevent your symptoms from getting worse and damaging your joints. Treatment can include medicine, lifestyle changes, and surgery. These may slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling.Your provider may use a combination of treatments. Your treatment may change based on your symptoms.You can help manage your RA symptoms if you:Are physically activeKeep a healthy weightAvoid injuries to your jointsAvoid activities that have repetitive motions, like bending your knee over and overStop smoking, or don't startNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is gout?Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis. It causes pain, swelling, and redness in one or more joints. It usually happens as a flare, which can last for a week or two and then gets better. The flares often begin in your big toe or a lower limb.What causes gout?Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods.When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee).However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid.Who is more likely to develop gout? Many people develop gout. You are more likely to get it if you:Are male.Are older; it usually develops in middle age.Have obesity.Have certain health conditions, such as: Heart failureHigh blood pressureMetabolic syndromeChronic kidney diseaseConditions that cause your cells to break down more quickly, such as psoriasis or some cancersRare genetic conditions that lead to increased uric acid Have a family history of gout.Have an unhealthy diet and eat foods that are rich in purines, such as red meat, organ meats, certain seafoods.Drink alcohol.Eat and drink lots of foods and beverages that contain fructose (a type of sugar).Take certain medicines, such as diuretics (water pills), low-dose aspirin, and some medicines that weaken your immune system.Take high amounts of niacin (vitamin B-3).What are the symptoms of gout?Gout usually happens in only one joint at a time. It is often found in the big toe, but can also affect other joints, including your other toes, ankle, and knee.Gout flares often start suddenly at night, and the symptoms in the affected joint often include:Intense pain, which may be bad enough to wake you upSwellingRednessWarmthThe flares typically get better within a week or two. In between flares, you usually don't have symptoms. Some people may have flares often, while others may not have another flare for years. But over time, if left untreated, your flares may happen more often and last longer. And if gout is untreated over long periods of time, you can develop tophi. Tophi are hard, uric acid deposits under the skin. They start out as painless, but over time, they can become painful. They can also cause bone and soft tissue damage and misshapen joints.How is gout diagnosed?To find out if you have gout, your health care provider:Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms.Will do a physical exam, including examining the affected joint(s).May order various tests, such as: A test of a sample of fluid from one of your painful joints. The fluid is examined under a microscope and is checked for uric acid crystals.A uric acid blood or urine test.An ultrasound or special CT scan to look for uric acid crystal buildup in the affected joint and check for other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. What are the treatments for gout?There are effective treatments for gout. Which treatment you get will depend on your symptoms and the cause of your gout. The goals of your treatment will be to:Reduce the pain from gout flares, by using medicines such as: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen.Acetaminophen and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine.Oral or injected corticosteroids. Prevent future flares, for example by: Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, limiting alcohol, and avoiding foods high in purines. If you are taking medicines that can cause high uric acid in the blood, your provider may suggest stopping or changing those medicines.If needed, taking medicines to lower uric acid in the blood. Prevent tophi and kidney stones, for example with medicines that lower uric acid in the blood.With early diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes, gout is one of the most controllable forms of arthritis. Treatment and lifestyle changes may help people avoid gout flares, lessen their symptoms, and sometimes even become gout free.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is osteoarthritis?Osteoarthritis, sometimes called OA, is a type of arthritis that only affects the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. It's the most common type of arthritis.In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area.There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms.What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?Osteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are:Pain when you move, which often gets better with restStiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from restingSwollen joints, especially after using the joint a lotLess movement in the joint than normalA joint that feels loose or unstableWhat causes osteoarthritis?Researchers aren't sure what causes osteoarthritis. They think that it could be caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. Your chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. They also know that some people are more likely to develop it than others.Who is more likely to develop osteoarthritis?Things that make you more likely to develop osteoarthritis include:Aging. Osteoarthritis can happen at any age, but the chance of getting it increases in middle-aged adults and older. After age 50, it is more common in women than in men.Being overweight. Extra weight puts more stress on your joints.Having a past injury or surgery on a joint. This is often the cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults.Doing a lot of activities that overuse the joint. This includes sports with a lot of jumping, twisting, running, or throwing.Having a joint that doesn't line up correctly.A family history of osteoarthritis. Some people inherit genetic changes that increase their chance of developing osteoarthritis.How is osteoarthritis diagnosed?There is no specific test for osteoarthritis. To find out if you have osteoarthritis, your provider:Will ask about your symptoms and medical historyWill do a physical examMay use x-rays or other imaging tests to look at your jointsMay order lab tests to make sure that a different problem isn't causing your symptomsWhat are the treatments for osteoarthritis?The goal of treating osteoarthritis is to ease your pain, help you move better, and stop it from getting worse.Treatment usually begins with:Exercises to improve strength, flexibility and balanceWeight loss, if needed, to improve pain, especially in your hips or kneesBraces or shoe inserts (orthotics) that a health care provider fits for youYou can buy some pain relievers and arthritis creams without a prescription. They can be helpful, but it's best to talk to your provider about using them. If they don't help enough, your provider may prescribe injections (shots) into the joint or prescription pain relievers.Complementary therapies may help some people. Massage can increase blood flow and bring warmth to the area. Some research shows that acupuncture may help relieve osteoarthritis pain. Simple things like heat and ice can help, too.If none of these treatments help enough, surgery may be an option. You and your provider can decide if it's right for you.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are joints?Your joints are places where two or more bones come together. Your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and knuckles are all joints. Your spine has joints, too.But joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move.What are joint disorders?Joint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury.What diseases can affect the joints?Many diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include:Arthritis. Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life.Lupus. This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis.Sjögren's Syndrome. This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too.Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms.What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries?Joint disorders from sudden injuries include:Sprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object.Dislocated joints. A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency.Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you:Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbnessCan't put weight on the jointHave pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another wayWhat types of joint disorders happen from overuse?Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting.Joint overuse injuries include:Bursitis. The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis.Tendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move.Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements.The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.How can I keep my joints healthy?Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better.When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads. If you already have joint problems, ask your provider what type of activities are best for you.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is Paget's disease of bone?Paget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder. Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones.What causes Paget's disease of bone?Researchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease.Who is at risk for Paget's disease of bone?The disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it.What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone?Many people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include:Pain, which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget'sHeadaches and hearing loss, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skullPressure on the nerves, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spineIncreased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases.Hip pain, if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighboneDamage to the cartilage of your joints, which may lead to arthritisUsually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones.What other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause?Paget's disease can lead to other complications, such as:Arthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the jointsHeart failure. In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries.Kidney stones, which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the bodyNervous system problems, since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.Osteosarcoma, cancer of the boneLoose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bonesVision loss, if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare.How is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptomsA physical examAn x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays.An alkaline phosphatase blood testA bone scanSometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason.What are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone?To avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include:Medicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease.Surgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to Allow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better positionReplace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritisRealign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the kneesReduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system Diet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program. You need to make sure that the exercise does not put too much stress on the affected bones.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may includeIncreased sensitivity to light, noise, and odorsNausea and vomitingWorsened pain when you move, cough, or sneezePostdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.How are migraines diagnosed?To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:Take your medical historyAsk about your symptomsDo a physical and neurological examAn important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.How are migraines treated?There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is caffeine?Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants including:Coffee beansTea leavesKola nuts, which are used to flavor soft drink colasCacao pods, which are used to make chocolate productsThere is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine, which is added to some medicines, foods, and drinks. For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and "energy-boosting" gums and snacks.Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally:An 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mgA 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mgAn 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mgAn 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mgWhat are caffeine's effects on the body?Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. It:Stimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energyIs a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating moreIncreases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburnMay interfere with the absorption of calcium in the bodyIncreases your blood pressureWithin one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.What are the side effects from too much caffeine?For most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as:Restlessness and shakinessInsomniaHeadachesDizzinessFast heart rateDehydrationAnxietyDependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same resultsSome people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.What are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem?Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What are antidepressants?Antidepressants are prescription medicines to treat depression. Depression is more than feeling a little sad or "blue" for a few days. It's a very common, serious medical illness that affects your mood and general mental health It can make you feel tired, hopeless, worried, or fearful. It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives.But antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.Are antidepressants used for other conditions?A health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety, chronic pain, or insomnia. Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions.What are the different types of antidepressants?There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems.Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groupsIf these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Even though these antidepressants may cause more serious side effects, the benefits may outweigh the risks for some people.Which type of antidepressant is right for me?Our bodies and brains all work differently. That means one antidepressant won't work for everyone. You may need to try two or more medicines before you find one that works for you.Your provider will work with you to choose the best option to try first. You'll consider questions such as:Which symptoms bother you most? Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping.What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs.Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too.Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment.Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding? If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby.How long do antidepressants take to work?Antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job.Sometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health.How long will I need to take an antidepressant?When an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.What are the side effects of antidepressants?Not everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine.The most common side effects from antidepressants include:Nausea and vomitingWeight gainDiarrheaSleepinessSexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sexWhen thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options.If you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own.If you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away.In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens.What can I do to take antidepressants safely?Antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too.Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine.Talk with your provider if side effects bother you.Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine.

Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma:Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small childBeing exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dustsGenetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergiesOften having viral respiratory infections as a young childSex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.What are the symptoms of asthma?The symptoms of asthma include:Chest tightnessCoughing, especially at night or early morningShortness of breathWheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe outThese symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.How is asthma diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:Physical examMedical historyLung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs workTests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effortFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.What are the treatments for asthma?If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include:Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.Control medicines. You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is asthma? Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.How does asthma affect children? Asthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But treatments can help manage asthma.What causes asthma in children?The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma.An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mitesMoldPetsPollen from grass, trees, and weedsWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold airCertain medicinesHousehold chemicalsInfections such as colds and the fluOutdoor air pollutionTobacco smoke Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dryAsthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.Which children are at risk for asthma?Certain factors raise the risk of asthma in children:Being exposed to secondhand smoke when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small childrenGenetics and family history. Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother. Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergiesOften having viral respiratory infections as young childrenSex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls.What are the symptoms of asthma in children?The symptoms of asthma in children include:Chest tightnessCoughing, especially at night or early morningBreathing problems, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for airFeeling tiredDark circles under the eyesBeing irritableWheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe outTrouble eating or sucking (in infants)These symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may happen often or only once in a while.When children have an asthma attack, their symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. Warning signs of a severe attack include severe coughing, serious breathing problems, and turning very pale or blue in the face, lips and/or fingernails. If your child has those symptoms, get medical help right away.How is asthma in children diagnosed?It can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead.Your child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:Physical examMedical historyChest x-rayLung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests.Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.If you have a young child who cannot do lung function tests, the provider may suggest doing a trial of asthma medicines. The trial involves giving your child the medicines for several weeks to see whether the symptoms get better.What are the treatments for asthma in children?If your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as:Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child, you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car.Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines.

MEDICAL CONDITION: Celiac Disease
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is celiac disease?Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problemsCeliac disease is triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements, hair and skin products, toothpastes, and lip balm.Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity. Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue. But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does. Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy, is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing. And a wheat allergy will not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.What causes celiac disease?The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease.Who is more likely to develop celiac disease?Celiac disease is more common if you:Have a family member who has the diseaseHave Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Williams syndromeAre WhiteAre femaleWhat are the symptoms of celiac disease?The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms.Some of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include:Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly)Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop)ConstipationGasLactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestineNausea and vomitingPain in the abdomen (belly)Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in childrenSome people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as:FatigueDepression and anxietyIrritability (in children)Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults)Bone or joint painSymptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouthWhat other problems can celiac disease cause?Over time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include:MalnutritionAnemia, especially iron-deficiency anemiaBone lossNervous system problems such as headaches, balance problems, or peripheral neuropathyReproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and womenHow is celiac disease diagnosed?If you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam.If your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy.What are the treatments for celiac disease?The treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list. Don't just assume that a product is gluten-free if it doesn't mention it.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

Gluten sensitivity may sometimes be called non-celiac gluten sensitivity or gluten intolerance.Gluten sensitivity is different from celiac disease. Both involve problems with gluten. They can also cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue. But celiac disease causes damage to the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity does not.Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy, is also different from gluten sensitivity and celiac disease. A wheat allergy can cause some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing. A wheat allergy does not damage the small intestine.In addition to abdominal pain and fatigue, gluten sensitivity can cause digestive symptoms. They may include gas, diarrhea, and constipation. You may also have other symptoms such as headaches, joint pain, and rashes.Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health care provider thinks you have it, they may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to make sure that you don't have celiac disease. This may be done with a blood test or biopsies of the small intestine.The symptoms of gluten sensitivity usually get better with a gluten-free diet. But it's important to make sure that you are still getting enough vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.To diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.Treatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is chronic bronchitis?Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.Chronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.What causes chronic bronchitis?The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them.Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis.Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis?The risk factors for chronic bronchitis include:Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke.Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.Age. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis?At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucusWheezingA whistling or squeaky sound when you breatheShortness of breath, especially with physical activityTightness in your chestSome people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed?Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, which includes asking about your symptomsA family historyVarious tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood testsWhat are the treatments for chronic bronchitis?There is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:Lifestyle changes, such as Quitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis.Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritantsAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.Medicines, such as Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.Vaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases.Antibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infectionOxygen therapy, if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may includeAn exercise programDisease management trainingNutritional counselingPsychological counselingA lung transplant, as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicinesIf you have chronic bronchitis, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.Can chronic bronchitis be prevented?Since smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elasticThe walls between many of the air sacs are destroyedThe walls of the airways become thick and inflamedThe airways make more mucus than usual and can become cloggedWhat are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?COPD includes two main types:Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them.

They work by killing the bacteria or by making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply.Antibiotics can be taken in different ways:Orally (by mouth). This could be pills, capsules, or liquids.Topically. This might be a cream, spray, or ointment that you put on your skin. It could also be eye ointment, eye drops, or ear drops.Through an injection or intravenously (IV). This is usually for more serious infections.What do antibiotics treat?Antibiotics only treat certain bacterial infections, such as strep throat, urinary tract infections, and E. coli.You may not need to take antibiotics for some bacterial infections. For example, you might not need them for many sinus infections or some ear infections. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed won't help you, and they can have side effects. Your health care provider can decide the best treatment for you when you're sick. Don't ask your provider to prescribe an antibiotic for you.Do antibiotics treat viral infections?Antibiotics do not work on viral infections. For example, you shouldn't take antibiotics for:Colds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow, or greenMost sore throats (except strep throat)FluMost cases of bronchitisWhat are the side effects of antibiotics?The side effects of antibiotics range from minor to very severe. Some of the common side effects include:RashNauseaDiarrheaYeast infectionsMore serious side effects can include:C. diff infections, which cause diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and sometimes even deathSevere and life-threatening allergic reactionsAntibiotic resistance infectionsCall your health care provider if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.Why is it important to take antibiotics only when they're needed?You should only take antibiotics when they are needed because they can cause side effects and can contribute to Antibiotic resistance infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when the bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. This means that the bacteria continue to grow.How do I use antibiotics correctly?When you take antibiotics, it is important that you take them responsibly:Always follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.Don't save your antibiotics for later.Don't share your antibiotic with others.Don't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else. This may delay the best treatment for you, make you even sicker, or cause side effects.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Acute coughs begin suddenly and usually last no more than 2 to 3 weeks. Acute coughs are the kind you most often get with a cold, flu, or acute bronchitis. Chronic coughs last longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Causes of chronic cough include:Chronic bronchitisAsthmaAllergiesCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) SmokingThroat disorders, such as croup in young childrenSome medicines Water can help ease your cough - whether you drink it or add it to the air with a steamy shower or vaporizer.

MEDICAL CONDITION: Bronchial Disorders
SOURCE: MedlinePlus API
CATEGORY: health_topic

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
When you breathe in, the air travels down through your trachea (windpipe). It then goes through two tubes to your lungs. These tubes are your bronchi. Bronchial disorders can make it hard for you to breathe.The most common problem with the bronchi is bronchitis, an inflammation of the tubes. It can be acute or chronic. Other problems include:Bronchiectasis - a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarredExercise-induced bronchospasm - a breathing problem that happens when your airways shrink while you are exercisingBronchiolitis - an inflammation of the small airways that branch off from the bronchiBronchopulmonary dysplasia - a chronic lung condition in infants, most often premature infants

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is the common cold?The common cold is a mild infection of your upper respiratory tract (which includes your nose and throat). Colds are probably the most common illness. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more. Colds are more common in the winter and spring, but you can get them at any time.What causes the common cold?More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type. The viruses that cause colds are very contagious. They can spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected when you touch something that has the virus on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. For example, you could get a cold after you shake hands with someone who has a cold or touch a doorknob that has the germs on it, and then touch your face.What are the symptoms of the common cold?The symptoms of a common cold usually include:SneezingStuffy nose (congestion)Runny noseSore throatCoughingHeadacheThe symptoms usually start a few days after you become infected with the virus. Some symptoms can last for 10-14 days.What are the treatments for the common cold?There is no cure for the common cold. But there are treatments that can make you feel better while you wait for the cold to go away on its own:Getting lots of rest.Drinking plenty of fluids.Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.Gargling with warm salt water.Using saline nose drops or sprays.Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines. But you need to be careful with certain medicines: Children and teens should not take aspirin.Some cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines.Some cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers. If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever. Read the labels on the medicines and follow the instructions carefully. If you have questions, ask your provider or a pharmacist. Antibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds.Most people who have a cold will feel better after a week or two. However, some people who get a cold may develop other illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. This is more common in people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or other respiratory conditions. Contact your provider if you or your child have symptoms that concern you, such as:Trouble breathing or fast breathingDehydrationFever that lasts longer than 4 daysSymptoms that last more than 10 days without improvementSymptoms, such as fever or cough, that improve but then return or worsenWorsening of chronic medical conditionsCan the common cold be prevented?There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by:Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick.Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch.Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands.Staying home when sick.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

MEDICAL INFORMATION:
What is the flu?The flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.What causes the flu?The flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.What are the symptoms of the flu?Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigue (tiredness)Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu. There are differences between them:Signs and SymptomsColdFluStart of symptomsSlowlySuddenlyFeverRarelyUsuallyAchesSometimes (slight)UsuallyFatigue, weaknessSometimesUsuallyHeadacheRarelyCommonStuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throatCommonSometimesSometimes people say that they have a "flu" when they really have something else.

Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:BronchitisEar infectionSinus infectionPneumoniaInflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu.Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including:Adults 65 and olderPregnant womenChildren younger than 5People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseaseHow is the flu diagnosed?To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.What are the treatments for the flu?Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.Can the flu be prevented?The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
